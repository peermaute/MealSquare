# MealSquare API
<img src="/src/main/resources/MealSquareLogo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"></img><br>
MealSquare is an application to help you sort out what you want to cook.<br>
The database contains a number of meals from my personal heavy rotation, but the best part is: **Everyone can contribute!** .<br>
The API is accessible via https://api.mealsquare.peermaute.com.

## Generate a meal plan
Generate a meal plan for the week - including a shopping list.\
You have some stuff left in your pantry or still want to have a small saying in what you eat: Use filters!

## Filters
Set your own restrictions on the generated meal plan so it won't be completely random, such as...

- "healthy"
- "contains carrots"
- carb base
  "noodle based, potatoe based, rice based, bread based"
- "mediterranean"

## Get ideas
Use these filters to get a couple of suggestions.
